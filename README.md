## **Project Structure**
```
ðŸ“‚ project-directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ Jenkinsfile           # Jenkins pipeline definition
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                # Testing scripts
```

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate the process of:
- Building the Flask application.
- Running tests.
- Deploying the app.

---

## **Prerequisites**
- **Jenkins Installed**: Locally or via a cloud-based instance.
- **Docker Installed**: Required for pipeline execution.
- **Python Environment**: Ensure Python 3.9 or later is used.

---

## **Pipeline Stages**
1. **Setup**: Install required dependencies for the app.
2. **Build**: Validate the codebase and syntax of `app.py`.
3. **Test**: Execute test cases to ensure application integrity.
4. **Deploy**: Launch the Flask app in a Docker container.

---

## **Getting Started**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd project-directory
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up Jenkins Pipeline
- Create a new Pipeline in Jenkins and link your repository.
- Use the provided `Jenkinsfile` in this repo to define the pipeline.

### Step 4: Test the Pipeline
Push changes to the repository and observe Jenkins executing the pipeline stages.

## **Usage**
1. To run the application manually:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Access the app in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:80
